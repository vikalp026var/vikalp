## 📈 Projects & Contributions
Here are some projects that showcase my skills:

### Machine Learning & AI:
- **Web Scraping** — Technologies: Python, Flask, AWS, Git
  - Utilized Python as the primary programming language, leveraging libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium to automate the data extraction process.
  - Developed efficient scraping scripts that navigated website structures, interacted with elements, and collected structured data from Flipkart with precision.
  
- **Diamond Price Prediction** — Technologies: Python, Machine Learning, Flask, Docker, AWS, DVC, Git, MLflow, Airflow
  - Achieved an accuracy of 97% using ML algorithms such as XGBoost, Lasso, and AdaBoost.
  - Developed a web application using Flask and Docker.

- **Development Of An AI Powered Chatbot For Automated Code Generation** — Technologies: Transformer, FAISS, LLM
  - Developed an AI-powered system for automated code generation using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, integrating a transformer model for information retrieval and the GEMMA LLM for code generation.
  - Trained the transformer model on the English-Python dataset and fine-tuned the GEMMA LLM using the FlyTech-25 dataset, utilizing FAISS as a vector database for efficient retrieval.
  - Created an end-to-end web application featuring a user-friendly interface and robust backend services, supporting functionalities such as user authentication, data management, and interactive elements to enhance user experience.

- **Telegram Question Answering Chatbot** — Technologies: Aiogram, BotFather, SerpAPI, GPT API, Langchain
  - Developed a Telegram chatbot using Aiogram and BotFather, integrating GPT API for natural language processing and SerpAPI for web search capabilities.
  - Created an end-to-end application that allows users to ask questions and receive instant answers, leveraging Langchain for enhanced dialogue management and context handling.

- **Text Summarization Using LLM** — Technologies: NLP, Hugging Face Hub, Flask, Docker, Git, AWS
  - Implemented a text summarization solution using the Google Pegasus model from Hugging Face, trained on the Samsum dataset for effective summarization of dialogue-based content.
  - Deployed the application on AWS for reliable hosting, enabling users to access the service from anywhere.
